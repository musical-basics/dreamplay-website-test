              {'"'}I{"'"}ve been a concert pianist for years, performing at

                    My hands span at exactly 8.0 inches. That meant many
                    traditional pieces were difficult, sometimes impossible, for
                    me to play comfortably. No matter how much I practiced, I
                    felt like the instrument wasn{"'"}t built for me.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4">
                    So I asked myself: {'"'}What if the piano could be designed
                    to fit the pianist, instead of the other way around?{'"'}
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4">
                    That{"'"}s where DreamPlay was born. Most pianos are designed
                    for large hand spans, at least 8.5 inches. But 87% of women
                    and 24% of men fall short of that. That means strain,
                    tension, and frustration. I know because I lived it.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4">
                    DreamPlay is the instrument I always wished I had: a
                    professional keyboard designed to fit your hands.
