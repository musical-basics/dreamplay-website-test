        question: "How does the free trade-in work?",
        answer:
            "When your child's hands grow beyond the DS5.5 sizing, simply contact us. Ship your DS5.5 back (buyer pays shipping) and we'll send a brand-new DS6.0 to your door. The upgrade itself is completely free when you purchase during our launch promotion.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is there a time limit on when I can trade in?",
        answer:
            "No. There's no expiration date on the trade-in. Whether your child outgrows the DS5.5 in 2 years or 10 years, the free upgrade is yours to use whenever you're ready. The only requirement is that you purchase during our launch promo.",
    },
    {
        question: "What condition does the DS5.5 need to be in?",
        answer:
            "Normal wear and tear is perfectly fine — it's a musical instrument, it should be played! As long as the keyboard is functional and not intentionally damaged, we'll accept it for trade-in.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do I need to pay for shipping?",
        answer:
            "Yes, the buyer is responsible for shipping costs. However, the upgrade itself from DS5.5 to DS6.0 is completely free when you purchase during our launch promotion.",
    },
    {
        question: "Why is this only available during the launch promo?",
        answer:
            "Our launch promo pricing gives us a unique opportunity to offer this trade-in program. As a thank-you to our earliest supporters, we're absorbing the cost of the upgrade. Once we move to standard retail pricing, this program will not be available.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can I trade a DS6.0 for a DS5.5 instead?",
        answer:
            "No. The trade-in program is designed for growing children — it only goes from DS5.5 to DS6.0 as their hands get bigger. If you ordered the wrong size, we offer a 90-day exchange period where you can swap for the correct model. Buyer pays shipping for exchanges.",
